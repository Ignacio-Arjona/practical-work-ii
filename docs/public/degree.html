                <p>Mathematics is the basic science par excellence whose knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation. A mathematician is a person with great critical thinking, with the capacity for abstraction and logical reasoning. It must be able to face complex problems, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, in addition to modeling possible solutions to said problems. The development of mathematics during the last two centuries has been surprising. This development has led to it becoming an increasingly basic and indispensable tool for the training and understanding of other Sciences. Furthermore, since the first steps of Engineering, in any of its modalities, mathematics has been a fundamental basis in its development.
                <br><br>Computer Engineering is the science and technology of the design, implementation and maintenance of the software and hardware components that make up modern computer systems. It is solidly based on theories and principles of computing, mathematics, physics and engineering and applies all of them to the resolution of technical problems that require the development of software, hardware and network architectures that present a balance between different requirements and conflicting objectives.

                <p>The double degree aims to cultivate professionals with expertise in both mathematical and computational skills, enabling them to solve complex problems in technology, research, and industry. It emphasizes critical thinking, analytical problem-solving, and the integration of theory with real-world applications through projects. The program prepares graduates to adapt to technological advancements and address global challenges in areas such as data science, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>

                <p>The program spans five academic years, during which students take a mix of courses from both disciplines. The curriculum is structured to provide foundational knowledge in the initial years, followed by specialized subjects and practical projects in later stages. Key components include:
                    <br><br><b>-Core Mathematics Subjects:</b> Covering calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
                    <br><b>-Core Computer Science Subjects:</b> Encompassing programming, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering.
                    <br><b>-Integrated Projects:</b> Facilitating the application of the concepts learnt to real-world scenarios.
                    <br><b>-Electives and Specializations:</b> Allowing students to point their studies into specific fields.
                <br><br>This structure ensures that graduates possess both theoretical knowledge and practical expertise, making them versatile professionals in the fields of mathematics and computer science.
